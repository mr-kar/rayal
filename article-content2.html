            <h2>Sheepskin Leather Jackets: The Basics</h2>
            <p>Sheepskin leather jackets are crafted from the hides of sheep, known for their supple texture and natural insulation.

                <li><span>Natural Sheen</span>: Garut sheepskin possesses a natural sheen that adds a touch of elegance to the jacket. This subtle luster enhances the overall appearance, making it a stylish choice for any occasion.</li>
                <li><span>Exceptional Durability</span>: Despite its delicate feel, Garut sheepskin is surprisingly durable and resistant to wear and tear. This ensures that your Garut leather jacket will maintain its quality and appearance for years to come.</li>
                <li><span>Unique Character</span>: Each Garut sheepskin leather jacket has its own unique character, with subtle variations in texture and color that add to its individuality. This makes your jacket a one-of-a-kind piece that reflects your personal style.</li>
